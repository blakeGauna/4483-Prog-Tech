## AO4 - P10783 - Odd Sum
### Blake Gauna
### Description:

This simple program is the solution for Odd Sum. It takes a number of test cases, and takes two numbers [a,b] and adds all the odd numbers
within them. For example:  [3, 9] is 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24. This is a simple looped % (mod) 2 approach and just keeping a sum.
